# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Designing a web app for a medical service viewer  i.e 
    -a user can check the nearest Blood Bank Location
    -a user can view the nearest Hospital 
    -a user can check the availability of the Blood at the nearest Blood Bank
Also, Connecting Google Maps fetches User's current location and directly provides the necessary details to the user, and manual support is also provided to the user.
